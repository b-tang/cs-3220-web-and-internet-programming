    <h1>Review: House of the Dragon's debut might win back aliented GoT fans</h1>
    <h2>Pilot can't quite escape the shadow of Game of Thrones, but it's eminently watchable.</h2>

    <p> Making a prequel to a beloved series is never easy, especially when it's a prequel to one of the most
        influential blockbuster series of the last decade—one that <a
            href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/here-is-our-super-spoiler-y-review-of-the-game-of-thrones-series-finale/">whiffed
            its finale</a> so badly that it alienated
        some of its most devoted fans. <a
            href="https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYsYeoAxKH8LCwgEAAAOR">HBO's <i>House of the
                Dragon</i></a> rose to the challenge, debuting last night with a solid,
        promising pilot episode. Granted, it suffers a bit in comparison with <i>Game of Thrones</i> (especially the
        earlier seasons).
        But this was an eminently watchable and entertaining pilot that might even win back some of those alienated fans
        if the rest
        of the season lives up to that promise.

    As <a
        href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/dragons-are-front-and-center-in-latest-house-of-the-dragon-trailer/">I've
        written previously</a>, <i>House of the Dragon</i> is set about 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones
    and chronicles the
    beginning of the end of House Targaryen's reign. Those events culminated in a civil war and the extinction of the
    dragons—at least
    until Daenerys Targaryen came along. The primary source material is <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_(novel)">Fire and Blood</a>, a fictional history of the
    Targaryen kings
    written by George R.R. Martin. The book begins with Aegon I's conquest of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, thanks to
    the family's
    advanced weaponry: dragons. This is followed by a period of relative peace before the inevitable succession crisis.
    The final two sections of <i>Fire and Blood</i> deal with the fallout of that crisis and serve as the primary source
    material for
    <i>House of the Dragon</i>.
